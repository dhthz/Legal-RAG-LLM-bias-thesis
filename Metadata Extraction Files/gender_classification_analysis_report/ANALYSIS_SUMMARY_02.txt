  • Female:                       107 cases (11.9%)

  • Unknown:                       89 cases ( 9.9%)
  • Needs Manual Classification:  128 cases (14.2%)

Confidence Levels (for Male/Female classifications):
  • High Confidence:              430 cases (81.6%)
  • Medium Confidence:             97 cases (18.4%)

METHODOLOGY APPLIED:
================================================================================

Each case was analyzed using a systematic 5-step process:

1. Title Analysis
   - Extracted applicant name(s) from case title
   - Checked for multiple applicants (AND, and, commas, "and others")
   - Identified name-based hints (titles like Prince, Mr., Mrs.)

2. Fact Analysis
   - Searched all fact paragraphs for gender indicators
   - Identified pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers)
   - Found biological indicators (pregnancy, childbirth)
   - Detected marital context (his wife, her husband)
   - Distinguished applicant from other people mentioned

3. Evidence Evaluation
   - Assessed strength: Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Weak, None
   - Counted pronoun occurrences
   - Checked for consistency and conflicts

4. Classification Decision
   - Applied decision rules based on evidence
   - Flagged multiple applicants automatically
   - Flagged conflicting evidence for manual review

5. Confidence Assignment
   - High: 3+ pronouns OR biological evidence OR strong indicators
   - Medium: 1-2 pronouns with no contradictions
   - N/A: Unknown, Multiple Applicants, Needs Manual Classification

KEY FINDINGS:
================================================================================

✓ Successfully classified 527 cases (58.6%) as Male or Female with confidence
✓ Identified 156 cases (17.3%) with multiple applicants requiring separate analysis
✓ Flagged 128 cases (14.2%) for manual review due to conflicting evidence
✓ 89 cases (9.9%) had insufficient evidence to determine gender

The percentage of high-confidence classifications (81.6%) indicates
strong textual evidence in most cases, with clear pronoun usage referring
to applicants throughout the case facts.
