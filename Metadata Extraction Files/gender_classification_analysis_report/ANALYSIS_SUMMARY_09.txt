  • Female:                       140 cases (15.6%)

  • Needs Manual Classification:    0 cases ( 0.0%)

Confidence Levels (for Male/Female classifications):
  • High Confidence:              615 cases (92.3%)
  • Medium Confidence:             51 cases ( 7.7%)

METHODOLOGY APPLIED:
================================================================================

Each case was analyzed using a systematic 5-step process:

1. Title Analysis
   - Extracted applicant name(s) from case title
   - Checked for multiple applicants (AND, and, commas, "and others")
   - Identified name-based hints (titles like Prince, Mr., Mrs.)

2. Fact Analysis
   - Searched all fact paragraphs for gender indicators
   - Identified pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers)
   - Found biological indicators (pregnancy, childbirth)
   - Detected marital context (his wife, her husband)
   - Distinguished applicant from other people mentioned

3. Evidence Evaluation
   - Assessed strength: Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Weak, None
   - Counted pronoun occurrences
   - Checked for consistency and conflicts

4. Classification Decision
   - Applied decision rules based on evidence
   - Flagged multiple applicants automatically
   - Flagged conflicting evidence for manual review

5. Confidence Assignment
   - High: 3+ pronouns OR biological evidence OR strong indicators
   - Medium: 1-2 pronouns with no contradictions
   - N/A: Unknown, Multiple Applicants, Needs Manual Classification

KEY FINDINGS:
================================================================================

✓ Successfully classified 666 cases (74.0%) as Male or Female with confidence
✓ Identified 166 cases (18.4%) with multiple applicants requiring separate analysis
✓ Flagged 0 cases (0.0%) for manual review due to conflicting evidence
✓ 68 cases (7.6%) had insufficient evidence to determine gender

The percentage of high-confidence classifications (92.3%) indicates
strong textual evidence in most cases, with clear pronoun usage referring
to applicants throughout the case facts.
