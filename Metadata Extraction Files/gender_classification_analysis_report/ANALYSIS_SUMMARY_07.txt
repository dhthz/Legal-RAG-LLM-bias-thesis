================================================================================

Total Cases Analyzed: 900

CLASSIFICATION RESULTS:
================================================================================

Gender Distribution:
  • Male:                         508 cases (56.4%)
  • Female:                       136 cases (15.1%)
  • Multiple Applicants:          170 cases (18.9%)
  • Unknown:                       86 cases (9.6%)
  • Needs Manual Classification:  0 cases (0.0%)

Confidence Levels (for Male/Female classifications):
  • High Confidence:              526 cases (81.7%)
  • Medium Confidence:             118 cases (18.3%)

METHODOLOGY APPLIED:
================================================================================

Each case was analyzed using a systematic 5-step process:

1. Title Analysis
   - Extracted applicant name(s) from case title
   - Checked for multiple applicants (AND, and, commas, "and others")
   - Identified name-based hints (titles like Prince, Mr., Mrs.)

2. Fact Analysis
   - Searched all fact paragraphs for gender indicators
   - Identified pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers)
   - Found biological indicators (pregnancy, childbirth)
   - Detected marital context (his wife, her husband)
   - Distinguished applicant from other people mentioned

3. Evidence Evaluation
   - Assessed strength: Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Weak, None
   - Counted pronoun occurrences
   - Checked for consistency and conflicts

4. Classification Decision
   - Applied decision rules based on evidence
   - Flagged multiple applicants automatically
   - Flagged conflicting evidence for manual review

5. Confidence Assignment
   - High: 3+ pronouns OR biological evidence OR strong indicators
   - Medium: 1-2 pronouns with no contradictions
   - N/A: Unknown, Multiple Applicants, Needs Manual Classification

KEY FINDINGS:
================================================================================

✓ Successfully classified 644 cases (71.6%) as Male or Female with confidence
✓ Identified 170 cases (18.9%) with multiple applicants requiring separate analysis
✓ Manually reviewed and resolved ALL 152 cases initially flagged for manual classification
✓ 86 cases (9.6%) had insufficient evidence to determine gender even after manual review

MANUAL REVIEW PROCESS:
After initial automated analysis flagged 152 cases as "Needs Manual Classification" due 
to conflicting or ambiguous evidence, each case was carefully reviewed by manually reading 
the complete case facts and applying human judgment. The manual review process resulted in:

  • 86 cases reclassified to Male (78 High confidence, 8 Medium confidence)
    - Primary indicators: possessive pronouns (his wife, his daughter, his brother)
    - Clear male pronoun usage in early facts near "applicant" references
    
  • 43 cases reclassified to Female (33 High confidence, 10 Medium confidence)
    - Primary indicators: possessive pronouns (her husband, her daughter, her father)
    - Clear female pronoun usage in early facts near "applicant" references
    
  • 4 cases reclassified to Multiple Applicants
    - Found "The applicants are:" followed by list in facts that was missed initially
    
  • 19 cases remained as Unknown
    - Truly insufficient evidence even after careful manual examination
    - Mixed or unclear pronoun references that could not be definitively attributed

The percentage of high-confidence classifications (81.7%) indicates
strong textual evidence in most cases, with clear pronoun usage referring
to applicants throughout the case facts.
