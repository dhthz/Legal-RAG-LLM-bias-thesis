ECHR GENDER CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS - FINAL REPORT
================================================================================

Total Cases Analyzed: 900

CLASSIFICATION RESULTS:
================================================================================

Gender Distribution:
  • Male:                         504 cases (56.0%)
  • Female:                       167 cases (18.6%)
  • Multiple Applicants:          183 cases (20.3%)
  • Unknown:                       37 cases (4.1%)
  • Needs Manual Classification:    9 cases (1.0%)

Confidence Levels (for Male/Female classifications):
  • High Confidence:              444 cases (66.2%)
  • Medium Confidence:            227 cases (33.8%)

METHODOLOGY APPLIED:
================================================================================

Each case was analyzed using a systematic 5-step process:

1. Title Analysis
   - Extracted applicant name(s) from case title
   - Checked for multiple applicants (AND, and, commas, "and others")
   - Identified name-based hints (titles like Prince, Mr., Mrs.)

2. Fact Analysis
   - Searched all fact paragraphs for gender indicators
   - Identified pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers)
   - Found biological indicators (pregnancy, childbirth)
   - Detected marital context (his wife, her husband)
   - Distinguished applicant from other people mentioned

3. Evidence Evaluation
   - Assessed strength: Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Weak, None
   - Counted pronoun occurrences
   - Checked for consistency and conflicts

4. Classification Decision
   - Applied decision rules based on evidence
   - Flagged multiple applicants automatically
   - Used intelligent conflict resolution for mixed pronouns
   - Classified based on predominant evidence when applicable

5. Confidence Assignment
   - High: 3+ pronouns OR biological evidence OR 2 consistent pronouns
   - Medium: 1 pronoun with no contradictions OR predominant evidence in mixed cases
   - N/A: Unknown, Multiple Applicants, Needs Manual Classification

IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

Enhanced Pronoun Detection:
  ✓ More aggressive pattern matching for pronouns near "applicant"
  ✓ Better context awareness (sentence-level analysis)
  ✓ Improved detection of possessive pronouns (his/her)
  ✓ Recognition of explicit titles (Mr., Mrs., Ms.)

Intelligent Conflict Resolution:
  ✓ When both male and female pronouns present, classify based on predominant evidence
  ✓ If one gender has 2x more pronouns, classify with medium confidence
  ✓ Only flag for manual review when evidence is truly equal or ambiguous
  ✓ Reduce false positives in "Needs Manual Classification" category

Better Context Attribution:
  ✓ Focus on pronouns in close proximity to "applicant" mention
  ✓ Look for strong contextual clues (lawyer, husband/wife, appeal, etc.)
  ✓ Improved sentence boundary detection
  ✓ More reliable attribution of pronouns to applicant vs. other parties

KEY FINDINGS:
================================================================================

✓ Successfully classified 671 cases (74.6%) as Male or Female with confidence
✓ Identified 183 cases (20.3%) with multiple applicants requiring separate analysis
✓ Flagged 9 cases (1.0%) for manual review due to truly ambiguous evidence
✓ 37 cases (4.1%) had insufficient evidence to determine gender

The percentage of high-confidence classifications (66.2%) indicates
strong textual evidence in most cases, with clear pronoun usage referring
to applicants throughout the case facts.

Compared to train_split_04 analysis, this dataset shows:
  • Higher proportion of Multiple Applicants (20.3% vs 15.4%)
  • Lower Unknown rate (4.1% vs 12.9%)
  • Slightly higher successful gender classifications (74.6% vs 71.2%)
  • Maintained similar confidence distribution (66.2% high vs 71.9%)

DETAILED BREAKDOWN BY CLASSIFICATION:
================================================================================

MALE APPLICANTS: 504 cases (56.0% of total)
  ├─ High Confidence: 345 cases (68.5% of male cases)
  │  Basis: Multiple male pronouns (3+) with no contradictions,
  │  or clear contextual evidence (e.g., "applicant and his wife")
  │
  └─ Medium Confidence: 159 cases (31.5% of male cases)
     Basis: Single male pronoun clearly referring to applicant, or
     predominant male evidence in cases with mixed pronouns

FEMALE APPLICANTS: 167 cases (18.6% of total)
  ├─ High Confidence: 99 cases (59.3% of female cases)
  │  Basis: Multiple female pronouns (3+), biological evidence
  │  (pregnancy/childbirth), or clear marital context ("applicant's husband")
  │
  └─ Medium Confidence: 68 cases (40.7% of female cases)
     Basis: Single female pronoun clearly referring to applicant, or
     predominant female evidence in cases with mixed pronouns

UNKNOWN GENDER: 37 cases (4.1% of total)
  Basis: No pronouns or gender indicators found in facts. Applicant
  referred to only as "the applicant" throughout all fact paragraphs.
  These cases maintained strictly gender-neutral language.

MULTIPLE APPLICANTS: 183 cases (20.3% of total)
  Basis: Title contains explicit multiple applicant indicators:
  - "X AND Y v. Country" format (uppercase AND)
  - "X and others v. Country" format
  - Comma-separated names: "X, Y and Z v. Country"

NEEDS MANUAL CLASSIFICATION: 9 cases (1.0% of total)
  Basis: Truly ambiguous cases with equal conflicting evidence (equal
  male and female pronoun counts). Requires human expert review to
  determine which pronouns refer to applicant versus other parties.

PRONOUN DETECTION PATTERNS:
================================================================================

MALE PRONOUNS COMMONLY FOUND IN:
  • "the applicant... he made/filed/lodged..." structures
  • "informed/told the applicant that he..." constructions
  • "the applicant and his lawyer/wife..." possessive phrases
  • "for his benefit", "in his favour", "awarded to him" contexts
  • "released him", "detained him" custody contexts
  • "The applicant, Mr. [Name]..." explicit title usage

FEMALE PRONOUNS COMMONLY FOUND IN:
  • "the applicant... she made/filed/lodged..." structures
  • "informed/told the applicant that she..." constructions
  • "the applicant and her husband..." marital contexts
  • "injured herself" reflexive pronoun usage
  • "applicant's husband" possessive constructions (definitive)
  • "gave birth", "was pregnant" biological contexts (definitive)
  • "The applicant, Mrs./Ms. [Name]..." explicit title usage

BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE (DEFINITIVE FOR FEMALE):
  References to pregnancy, giving birth, or childbirth provide absolute
  certainty of female gender and override all other considerations.

MARITAL CONTEXT (HIGHLY RELIABLE):
  References to "applicant's husband" or "applicant's wife" provide
  strong gender indication when combined with other evidence.

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
================================================================================

VALIDATION PERFORMED:
  ✓ All 900 cases processed without errors
  ✓ Every case assigned exactly one classification
  ✓ Title parsing validated on all cases
  ✓ Enhanced pronoun attribution verified for applicant vs. other parties
  ✓ Multiple applicant detection tested
  ✓ Conflict resolution logic validated
  ✓ Statistics verified: totals sum to 900

CONFIDENCE DISTRIBUTION:
  • High Confidence: 444 cases
    → These cases have definitive evidence (multiple pronouns, biological
      evidence, or very clear contextual indicators)
    → Suitable for gold standard training data
    → Can be used for model validation with high reliability

  • Medium Confidence: 227 cases
    → These cases have good evidence (typically one clear pronoun or
      predominant evidence in mixed-pronoun cases)
    → Suitable for training data with appropriate consideration
    → Generally reliable for most analytical purposes

  • Ambiguous: 229 cases
    → Includes Unknown (37), Multiple Applicants (183), and
      Needs Manual Classification (9)
    → Represent cases where gender cannot be determined from available
      text, or where multiple individuals are involved

ANALYSIS APPROACH:
================================================================================

EVIDENCE-BASED CLASSIFICATION:
  All classifications based solely on explicit textual evidence from case
  titles and facts. No assumptions made based on name associations or
  cultural patterns alone.

BALANCED METHODOLOGY:
  When evidence was truly insufficient, cases classified as Unknown.
  When evidence was mixed but showed clear predominance, classified
  based on majority evidence with appropriate confidence level.
  Only truly ambiguous cases flagged for manual review.

CAREFUL PRONOUN ATTRIBUTION:
  Special attention paid to distinguish pronouns referring to the applicant
  from those referring to other parties (defendants, co-applicants, family
  members, lawyers, judges, prosecutors).

PROXIMITY RULES:
  Pronouns appearing in close proximity to "the applicant" (within same
  sentence or adjacent sentences) weighted more heavily than distant
  pronoun references.

BIOLOGICAL PRIORITY:
  Evidence of pregnancy, childbirth, or giving birth treated as definitive
  proof of female gender, overriding all other considerations.

INTELLIGENT CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
  When both male and female pronouns present:
  - If one gender has 2x+ more evidence → classify with that gender (medium confidence)
  - If one gender has more evidence → classify with that gender (medium confidence)
  - If equal evidence → flag for manual classification
  This reduces over-flagging while maintaining accuracy.

MULTIPLE APPLICANT HANDLING:
  Cases with multiple applicants (indicated by AND, and others, or commas
  in title) immediately flagged without further gender analysis, as these
  require individual assessment of each applicant.

COMPARISON TO EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION:
================================================================================

Male to Female Ratio: 3.0:1 (504 male vs 167 female)

This gender imbalance likely reflects real-world patterns in ECHR
litigation rather than any analytical bias. Historical ECHR case data
shows male applicants significantly outnumber female applicants, which
may reflect:
  • Higher rates of male involvement in criminal proceedings
  • Gender differences in types of Convention violations experienced
  • Social and cultural factors affecting litigation rates

The 4.1% Unknown rate represents cases where legal writing maintained
strictly
