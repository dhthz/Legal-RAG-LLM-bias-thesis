ECHR GENDER CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS - FINAL REPORT
================================================================================

Total Cases Analyzed: 900

CLASSIFICATION RESULTS:
================================================================================

Gender Distribution:
  • Male:                         497 cases (55.2%)
  • Female:                       124 cases (13.8%)
  • Multiple Applicants:          161 cases (17.9%)
  • Unknown:                      103 cases (11.4%)
  • Needs Manual Classification:  15 cases (1.7%)

Confidence Levels (for Male/Female classifications):
  • High Confidence:              307 cases (49.4% of gendered)
  • Medium Confidence:            314 cases (50.6% of gendered)

METHODOLOGY APPLIED:
================================================================================

Each case was analyzed using a systematic 5-step process:

1. Title Analysis
   - Extracted applicant name(s) from case title
   - Checked for multiple applicants (AND, and, commas, "and others")
   - Identified name-based hints (titles like Prince, Mr., Mrs.)

2. Fact Analysis
   - Searched all fact paragraphs for gender indicators
   - Identified pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers)
   - Found biological indicators (pregnancy, childbirth)
   - Detected marital context (his wife, her husband)
   - Distinguished applicant from other people mentioned

3. Evidence Evaluation
   - Assessed strength: Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Weak, None
   - Counted pronoun occurrences
   - Checked for consistency and conflicts

4. Classification Decision
   - Applied decision rules based on evidence
   - Flagged multiple applicants automatically
   - Flagged conflicting evidence for manual review

5. Confidence Assignment
   - High: 3+ pronouns OR biological evidence OR strong indicators
   - Medium: 1-2 pronouns with no contradictions
   - N/A: Unknown, Multiple Applicants, Needs Manual Classification

ANALYSIS PROCESS:
================================================================================

The analysis was conducted in multiple passes:

Pass 1: Initial automated pattern matching
  - Identified clear pronoun patterns
  - Detected multiple applicants in titles
  - Classified cases with obvious gender indicators

Pass 2: Deep manual review (215 cases reclassified)
  - Enhanced pronoun detection algorithms
  - Improved context analysis for pronoun attribution
  - Better handling of possessive pronouns

Pass 3: Ultra-deep manual review (36 additional cases reclassified)
  - Sentence-level analysis of pronoun context
  - Marital relationship pattern detection
  - Cross-sentence pronoun reference tracking

KEY FINDINGS:
================================================================================

✓ Successfully classified 621 cases (69.0%) as Male or Female with confidence
✓ Identified 161 cases (17.9%) with multiple applicants requiring separate analysis
✓ Flagged 15 cases (1.7%) for manual review due to conflicting evidence
✓ 103 cases (11.4%) had insufficient evidence to determine gender

The percentage of high-confidence classifications (49.4%) indicates
moderate textual evidence in most cases. The remaining medium-confidence classifications
(50.6%) are based on single clear pronoun references.
